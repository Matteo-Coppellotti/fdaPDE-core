This repository contains the C++, header-only, core library system for the fdaPDE project, providing basic functionalities like a finite element solver for second-order linear elliptic boundary value problems, nonlinear unconstrained optimization algorithms, linear and non-linear system solvers, multithreading support, and more.

## Documentation
Documentation can be found on our [documentation site](https://fdapde.github.io/)

## Dependencies
fdaPDE-core is an header-only library, therefore it does not require any installation. Just make sure to have it in your include path. Neverthless, to compile code including this library you need:
* A C++20 compliant compiler. Supported versions are:
     * Linux: `gcc` 11 (or higher), `clang` 15 (or higher)
	 * macOS: `apple-clang` (the XCode version of `clang`, AppleClang 15 or higher).
* The [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) linear algebra library, version 3.4.0.

If you wish to run the test suite contained in the `test/` folder, be sure to have [Google Test](http://google.github.io/googletest/) installed.
